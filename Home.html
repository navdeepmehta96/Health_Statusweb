            <br>There are two main types of blood glucose tests:
            Capillary blood glucose test: A healthcare professional collects a drop of blood â€” usually from a fingertip prick. These tests involve a test strip and glucose meter (glucometer), which show your blood sugar level within seconds.
            Venous (plasma) blood glucose test: A phlebotomist collects a sample of blood from a vein (venipuncture). These glucose tests are usually part of a blood panel, such as a basic metabolic panel. The provider will send the samples to a lab. There, a medical laboratory scientist will prepare your samples and perform the test on machines known as analyzers.
